A Git tutorial and exercise for Women Who Code

In Order to run this sprint you will need to get a good understanding of GIT. I recommend allocating a couple of hours like 4 or so and go over the git documentation which can be found here http://git-scm.com/doc. Once you understand git well and if you use it on a day to day basis it is easier to teach it. This repository has a power point file which I used to run the sprint at Women Who Code Ruby in San Francisco. You can use the file and go over it and you can ask the attendees to perform the exercises in this repository. You can also find the powerpoint file in the slideshare http://www.slideshare.net/NagaSowjanyaMudunuri
